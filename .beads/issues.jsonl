{"id":"claude-z-spec-plugin-18v","title":"Add standalone CLI","description":"The portfolio philosophy is that tools should work both as CLI and as plugin — not just one or the other. Z Spec is currently plugin-only. A standalone CLI wrapping fuzz and probcli with the plugin's ProB compatibility rules would be useful independently of Claude Code.\n\nMinimum CLI surface:\n- z-spec check \u003cfile\u003e — type-check with fuzz\n- z-spec test \u003cfile\u003e — animate/model-check with probcli\n- z-spec doctor — verify dependencies (see related bead)\n\nThe CLI would apply the same ProB compatibility transforms (ZBOOL, bounded integers, flat schemas) that the plugin commands encode in their prompts, but as deterministic code.","status":"open","priority":4,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jmf@pobox.com","created_at":"2026-02-17T08:35:35.52761-08:00","created_by":"\"jmf-pobox\"","updated_at":"2026-02-17T08:35:35.52761-08:00"}

{"id":"claude-z-spec-plugin-p81","title":"Integrate Quarry for domain knowledge during spec generation","description":"PR/FAQ already uses Quarry as an optional dependency to enhance its research phase. Z Spec should do the same — when Quarry is installed, commands like /z create and /z code2model could search the user's indexed documents for domain knowledge (requirements docs, design docs, API specs, prior specifications) to produce more accurate Z specifications.\n\nUse case: a user has indexed their project's design documentation, API contracts, and requirements in Quarry. When they run /z create, the plugin searches Quarry for relevant domain context before generating the spec. This helps produce specifications that use correct domain terminology, capture real invariants, and reflect actual business rules rather than guessing from code alone.\n\nSimilarly, /z elaborate could pull narrative from indexed design docs rather than requiring the user to point at specific files.\n\nPattern to follow: PR/FAQ's researcher agent checks for Quarry MCP tools and uses search_documents when available, falling back gracefully when Quarry is not installed.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jmf@pobox.com","created_at":"2026-02-17T08:50:13.762566-08:00","created_by":"\"jmf-pobox\"","updated_at":"2026-02-17T08:50:13.762566-08:00"}
